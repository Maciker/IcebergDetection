# IcebergDetection
Icebergs present serious hazards for ship navigation and offshore installations. Consequently, there is a large interest to localize them in timely and over vast areas. Because of their independence of cloud cover and daylight, satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are among the preferred data sources for operational ice conditions and iceberg occurrences. The image spatial resolution mostly used for iceberg monitoring varies between a few and 100 m. Processed SAR data are characterized by speckle noise, which causes a grainy appearance of the images making the identification of icebergs extremely difficult. The methods of satellite monitoring of dangerous ice formations, like icebergs in the Arctic seas represent a threat to the safety of navigation and economic activity on the Arctic shelf.

The main aim of this project is to build a model that automatically identifies whether a remotely sensed target is an iceberg or not. Often times an iceberg is wrongly classified as a ship. The algorithm had to be extremely accurate because lives and billions of dollars in energy infrastructure are at stake.
